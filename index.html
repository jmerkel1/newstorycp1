The Film
	

	Someone is sitting in the dark. Alone. The only light in the room is the light coming from the Tv. It’s his last film. Now because of the existence of The others, they changed it from the last meal to the last film. He chooses one labeled only “The Slaughter of 2035”. The film starts. “The year is 2035, The Others also known as Reds have been known of for 10 years. The red zones are over populated so much so that they take up ¼ of each city and contain ⅓ of each cities population. Reds can be identified through a chip which makes their eyes turn red. There is no cure yet and no way to identify them at birth, only the chip allows people to see who they are, unless of course, they reveal themselves. In the summer of 2035, there was a series of home invasions which were perpetrated by 3 men. Their names were George Wilson, Alex Randers, and Rick Hills. They were all found dead, torn to shreds in the outskirts of Chicago.
What you are about to see is the most accurate depiction of what happened the night of July 18th, 2035. The night of the slaughter of 2035.” 

    As the films opening scene ends, it fades and opens on a black van. The lights of the street reflecting off the sides and the tinted windows. Voices begin to come but no one is seen yet. “Listen it’s an easy one, nowhere near a red zone, we have absolutely no chance of running into any reds”. “You don’t get it, Chicago has the highest population of them, we’ve robbed 5 houses and I’m still surprised we haven’t run into any”. “That's cause the news lies to you making you think it’s a bigger deal than it actually is.'' . A dark figure steps into the frame, “George what are you doing” said another voice. “I just taking a look calm your shit,” said George. “Hey Alex, nice hat dumbass”. “Screw you, I paid good money for this rick,” said Alex.
“Who…..” said Rick. “What do you mean-” said Alex. “Asked?” said Rick while cutting Alex off.  “Both of you shut up, they’re lights just went off,” said George. “Let's do this,” said Rick. 
As they make their way through the backyard a light in the backyard turns on. “SHIT!” said Alex. “Relax,” said George, “It’s just a motion sensor calm down”. “Do you have the cutter?” 
said George. Rick hands George the cutter and they quietly cut a hole in the glass. They walk through the house which is eerily painted bright white in every hallway. They begin to look. George sends Rick down to the basement, he continues through the living room with Alex looking for anything valuable. They spot 3 rings on the coffee table, George pulls a device out of his pocket and it begins to scan. It reads that the rings are 23K gold. He has Alex grab them and they head to the basement to look for Rick. “Rick!” Alex whispers loudly. They head down and just see this look on rick’s face. It’s almost as he is shocked as if he got bad news about a family member. George and Alex move closer as the stairs are blocking the sight of horror rick sees. That’s when they see it. The cage. Big enough to fit ten people in. The claw marks on the paint, the blood permanently staining the white floors a brightly colored red. “What the….” before Alex finishes his sentence he is hit on the back of the head. George turns around and sees Alex on the floor. Above him is a man half changed, and no red eyes. He faints. 

When he wakes up he sees Rick in front of him tied up. He turns and sees Alex on a table in the middle of the room, strapped to it. He turns the other way and sees the man. “Screw you,” says George to the man. “You don’t know what I am doing you?” said the man. “I know what you are you filthy fucking red,” said George. “I never liked that word. It’s so negative, you know we have another name right? Well I should say names.” said the man. “Names?” said George. “You do know that we are an entirely different species right? You must know we have subspecies. We have tallots, mags, quersos, and lobos.” said the man. “The hell is a quersos?” said rick. “Let Me show you…” said the man. He turns around, his skin begins to turn dark green. His eyes yellow. His Teeth razor sharp. Claws grow from where his fingers once were. Finally, a tail extends with a razor spiked edge on the end of it. “ This is a quersos,” said the man. “HOLY SHIT!” said Rick. The quersos begins to move forward toward them. Alex then wakes up and sees the beast.

    He screams “WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!”. The quersos begins to move toward Alex now, as he screams horrifically. The monster has a roar almost that of a man with a raspy voice. It speaks, “THIS IS WHAT I AM!” says the beast. He finally silences Alex with one blow to the side of the head. This strike was so powerful it twisted Alex's head a full 180 degrees. The 
monster then turns toward the remaining survivors. He moves toward rick first. “You piece of shit! You ain’t got the guts.” Rick screamed. The beast begins to make quick work of Rick. He drives his clawed hands into his chest. “Screw you…..” ricks says choking on his last breath while spitting up blood. “Looks like you don’t have the guts either,” said the beast as he pulls his hands from rick’s chest completely slicing him open. The Beast looks towards George. “I’ll be able to get by for the next two months with just these two. You and I are going to have a little more fun.” says the monster. 
The film begins to fade to black, and a rolling piece of dialogue starts to play.

 “The man named Ben Ryder realized there was a police car at the house. Someone had seen the men enter the house. He was able to quickly deceive them as the fear of the others caused officers to be much more wary of the surroundings. He quickly disposed of the bodies. Once they were found, the police linked the murders to him through the DNA of the skin cells inside ricks wounds from the claws. They quickly arrested him and he was sentenced to death. His Execution date, June 12, 2050.” The film ends. The man sitting in the dark corner is alone, no sound, no light, nothing. He finally says something to the guard. “That was pretty close to the real thing, pity though, they didn’t quite get the deaths right.” said the man. “What do you mean?” said the guard. The man in the corner flicks on a light and says “They died a lot more painfully and slowly.” The man looks at the officer, he begins to lick his lips. “You know they forgot to give me the cure, I was locked up for so long I was forgotten,” said the man. He looks at the officer and his eyes slowly turn yellow. “I clawed the chip out myself,” said the man. The officer is now banging screaming for his life. He turns around and sees the man with his finger on the light switch, he turns it off. Leaving him alone in the dark with his final meal.</p>
